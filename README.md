# leetCodeLearnings


This repository contains my solutions to LeetCode problems, categorized by their difficulty level: easy, medium, and hard. Each solution is written in Java.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into three main folders based on the difficulty of the problems:

- **easy**: Contains solutions to easy LeetCode problems.
- **medium**: Contains solutions to medium LeetCode problems.
- **hard**: Contains solutions to hard LeetCode problems.

Each folder contains Java files where each file represents a specific LeetCode problem solution.

## How to Use

You can browse the repository to find solutions to specific LeetCode problems categorized by their difficulty level. Each Java file is named with the LeetCode problem number and title for easy navigation.
